buildings ever conceived has been named the winner of the 2018 stirling prize beating off competition from a quirky brick nursery a mudwalled cemetery and the extension of the tate st ives gallery the 1bn european headquarters for bloomberg designed by foster  partners stands in the city of london as a gargantuan temple to gadgetry its every detail subjected to months of research and development as the ribas president ben derbyshire put it the architects have not just raised the bar for office design and city planning but smashed the ceiling the 1 million sq ft complex is kitted out with vacuumflush toilets breathing gills in the facade a petalstudded ceiling that provides lighting cooling and acoustic attenuation and a host of other features that mean it should use 70 less water and 40 less energy than a typical office block it is the kind of noexpensespared statement you might expect from its billionaire client michael bloomberg the former mayor of new york the author of climate of hope and the boss of this financial software data and media empire it is an elaborate monument to his belief that businesses have a role to play in saving the planet as grand corporate gestures go it does its best to be demure many companies of our size would have opted for a glass skyscraper bloomberg said at the buildings opening but we place value on being good neighbours we are conscious of the fact we are guests in london an earlier scheme for the site designed by foster for a different client imagined a dark glass tower rising to 22 storeys capped with a domed hat earning it the nickname darth vaders helmet bloombergs vision is a squatter affair of two 10storey blocks either side of a new arcade lined with food outlets selected by bloombergs food critic connected by a bridge and dressed in a polite costume of sandstone and bronze standing across from fosters bulbous glass walbrook building it shows just how willing the architect is to turn his hand to whatever the client wants     the exterior of the bloomberg headquarters in london photograph alamy    the visitor experience is meticulously choreographed like few other corporate hqs you arrive into the vortex a lobby of swirling timber shells with a feeling of walking into a richard serra sculpture from where cantilevered glass lifts whisk you up to the sixthfloor pantry  a staff breakout area conceived on the scale of an airport terminal this voluminous greeting relaxing collaborating space is flanked by fish tanks and vast windows framing views of st pauls cathedral as if captured in a vitrine for the

flaps that open and close automatically allowing the building to breathe while softening traffic noise from outside     a great bronze ramp coils through the floors providing a possibility for chance encounters photograph alamy    all of these innovations underwent relentless refinement and optimisation at a dedicated test facility in battersea where the natural ventilation system was modelled with water by fluiddynamics experts and 11 mockups regularly examined by bloomberg himself in a rare level of handson involvement some people say the reason it took almost a decade to build this is because we had a billionaire who wanted to be an architect quipped bloomberg working with an architect who wanted to be a billionaire but for all their trailblazing innovations it is hard to escape the feeling of being trapped in a very deepplan office building very far from a window with views to the outside world often obscured by the big bronze baffles it is a very inwardlooking place lest employees be distracted from their duties to planet bloomberg the incorporation of the roman temple of mithras in the basement might make some uneasy about the companys ambitious level of stewardship while the 600 tonnes of bronze imported from japan and the quarryfull of granite from india also make you wonder about the projects true environmental credentials   related reconstructed roman temple of mithras opens to public in london    it marks the third time that norman fosters practice has won the stirling prize having previously taken the accolade for the elliptical hangar of the imperial war museum duxford in 1998 and the magnificent gherkin in 2004 bloomberg was the favourite to win at 31 odds and it shouldnt be a surprise the prize is explicitly awarded to the building that makes the biggest contribution to the evolution of architecture and fosters hightech innovations will no doubt influence the future of office design the bloomberg european headquarters triumphed over the

5,artanddesign/2018/oct/10/bauhaus-josef-anni-albers-art,Josef and Anni Albers: the Bauhaus misfits who scaled art's peaks,on 5 december 1933 the asheville citizen ran a photograph over the lukewarm caption germans to teach art near here the germans in question  the couple in the photo  were josef and anni albers they had arrived in the united states from berlin a week earlier six months before that menaced by the nazis the bauhaus had closed its doors the albers had spent more than a decade teaching there he as meister of the foundation course she as head of the weaving workshop desperate to leave germany  annis family were jewish  they had taken jobs in a place neither had heard of poring over an atlas the pair had searched in vain for north carolina in maps of the philippines the bauhaus had been the worlds most renowned design school the school they were to teach at now had 30 students was six months old in the back of beyond and completely unknown it had no art department it was called black mountain college     fresh off the boat  josef and anni albers on the ss europa arriving in new york in 1933 photograph ap    what the albers did there is still being felt when the architect philip johnson recommended josef albers to black mountains founder and first rector as a teacher of art he had added the caveat he has one defect i thought my god theres a cleft palate coming up john andrew rice recalled because i knew a linguistic expert who had a cleft palate or hes blind johnsons defect in fact was that albers spoke no english rice relieved said whats the matter with that and gave him the job   related anni albers review  ravishing textiles that beg to be touched    the gamble paid off by the time the albers arrived in asheville josef had acquired enough english to answer the question of his ambitions at the school with the eloquently inarticulate line to make open the eyes he had turned 45 that march too old as he said to learn another flexibility of the mouth when he died in connecticut 43 years later his speech was still famously hitandmiss as the wife of one black mountain colleague was to put it albers had a wonderful inability with english this turned out to be a unexpected plus lacking words josef fell back on gestures photographs of his classes at the bauhaus show students standing in a respectful circle while their professor talks them theatrically through their work photos at black mountain show him waving his arms and standing on chairs pulling dramatic faces and tracing squares in the air with his forefinger his students like a happy corps de ballet imitate him art became a matter not just of the eye but of the body art is performance josef said he had already broadened the idea of what it might be by having his students work with coke bottles bits of wire lucky strike packets moss now their very movements were made a material     what a performance  josef albers teaching at black mountain college ca1948

the schools alumni and staff had taken its message out into the world robert rauschenbergs combines owe their ordered mess to the matière lessons their creator had with josef at black mountain in 1949 the composer john cage whom albers had invited to teach at the school likened their ideas on performance to peas in a pod in 1952 three years after the albers had left black mountain for yale cage and his partner merce cunningham staged a musiccumdance piece in the college dining hall using rauschenbergs white paintings as decor it has a good claim to having been the worlds firstever happening

expect as the fabled design school nears its centenary  it opened in weimar on 1 april 1919  the bauhaus remains undyingly cool the distant descendants of marianne brandts lamp can be found in any

to a man middle class paul klees father was a musicologist kandinskys a vaguely aristocratic tea broker bauhaus founder walter gropiuss like his son a successful architect josefs father was a painter and decorator from a coalmining town in the ruhr the others had been educated at gymnasiums josef at a humble church school he spoke to his dying day with a ruhrpott accent it took years for gropius to make him a meister while younger men such as lászló moholynagy  a universitytaught lawyer with nice vowels  were promoted over his head     a 1950s 12 shaft counter march handloom similar to those

most women at the school was pushed into weaving these limp threads she recalled disgusted a shared sense of ill treatment drew the 34yearold exschoolteacher from bottrop and the 23yearold berlin socialite together at black mountain dressed invariably in white they would be known as male and female of the same species it was the adversity they had faced at the bauhaus that had made them so whatever their differences in background as artists their reaction to maltreatment was the same directed by gropius to serve an apprenticeship in the bauhauss wallpainting workshop josef pointed out that his father was a painter and decorator and that he had been painting walls since he was a boy when gropius said that he would nonetheless have to attend the workshop or leave the bauhaus albers became as he said a freelance doing the bare minimum of classwork he took to the rubbish dumps of weimar there he found the bits of broken glass and wire that he turned into socalled shard paintings  works such as gitterbild and kaiserlich which look like church windows but are made out of junk flicking two grimy fingers at authority they are perhaps the most original artworks to come out of the early bauhaus and certainly the most bolshy gropius understood this in march 1921 he saw one of the glasbilder in a show of student work at the schools gallery on the strength of it albers was taken

worth remembering that we have imagined the the bauhaus in our own image as egalitarian genderequal  in short as modern in fact neither josef nor anni albers had any wish to replicate the school in

6,artanddesign/2018/oct/10/please-dont-wake-hippo-victoria-albert-photography-centre-unpacks-glorious-photography-archive,Please don't wake the hippo! The V&A unpacks its glorious photography archive,the first thing you see as you enter the victoria and alberts newly expanded photography centre is a huge plate camera on a wooden tripod it belonged to henry fox talbot the founding father of british photography in an adjacent glass case an array of his other cameras are on show alongside his notebooks and an original copy of his photography book the pencil of nature the centres inaugural exhibition is collecting photography from daguerreotype to digital but it is the process of photography that is the intriguing subtext there are now two main galleries rather than one devoted to the vampas photography collection which means there is now ample room to view the prints on display in an expanded context that illuminates their production the most visible evidence of this is the vast glass display cases that house not just cameras but early photography books manuals notebooks and periodicals as well as one given over to viewing early stereoscopic images most of the other changes made to these repurposed victorian picture galleries are invisible to the eye including the complex climate control technology that protects the prints     fleeing his myth  paul mccartney with stella and james in a shot by linda on the mull of kintyre in 1982 photograph linda mccartney     among the highlights in the first gallery is a grid of photographs from the collection of chauncy hare townshend the 19thcentury poet clergyman and mesmerist who  alongside prince albert  was the only private english collector of early prints among them are various pictorial rural landscapes a studio portrait of british bare knuckle boxing champion tom sayers and the strangely atmospheric study of sheep taken in 1854 by camille silvy who moved easily between the studio the street and the countryside in search of subject matter and who was described by his more famous contemporary nadar as a zélateur or enthusiast stranger still is an early portrait of a slumbering hippopotamus by the extravagantly titled don juan mario isidro de borbon count of montizón the setting is london zoo where the hippo drew huge crowds having been captured on the banks of the white nile and brought to london as a gift for queen victoria later in the gallery a seemingly conceptual arrangement of objects  gloves coins nails pieces of rope and fabric  turns out to be a bizarre still life also taken in london zoo by frederick william bond it is titled contents of an ostrichs stomach close to the pencil of nature is the first commercially produced photography book one of anna atkinss beautiful botanical studies from 1854 festuca ovina fescuie grass atkins is now acknowledged as both the first female photographer and the first person to make a photography book her cyanotypes were created without a camera by placing specimens directly on to chemically treated paper and allowing sunlight to create a painterly silhouette effect     peckish

moments that seem almost modernist frederick holland days 1905 head of a girl hampton virginia is a blurred slightly offcentre portrait of a young black girl that has a timeless quality likewise the fulllength selfportrait by edward steichen from 1933 in which he poses as if on the threshold of a doorway which is actually a tiny blank empty picture frame on the wall behind him steichen is a definite presence here with a glass case housing spreads from his groundbreaking journal camera work published quarterly from 1903 to 1917 his striking colour portrait of socialite and vanity fair editor clare boothe luce dates from 1938 but looks as if it could have been taken just a few years ago an even more surprising example of early colour is an impressionistic amsterdam street scene from 1934 by bernard eilers in which blurred shop lights are reflected on a wet street in a haze of dark blues and reds eliers atmospheric image anticipates the painterly style of saul leiters new york street photographs made two decades later against all this invention the work in the second gallery seems almost from a different exhibition the highlight for me is the large grid of 30 street photographs by mark cohen his oddly composed closeup images of children and teenagers on the streets of his hometown wilkesbarre pennsylvania gleefully disrupt the usual tropes of street photography this is a dance of gestures and shapes hands feet and arms filling the frame facial expressions and skin tones caught in warm natural colours cohens style is so singular that these images add up to an exhibition within an exhibition     fascinating  thomas ruffs reimagining of the work of the victorian soldier linnaes tripe photograph ellie atkins courtesy of thomas ruff and david zwirner galleryjpg    it was also good to come upon a characteristically gritty street tableau by the elusive graham smith arguably the most gifted and certainly the least known of a generation of british documentary photographers working in the 1970s and 80s on a street in his hometown  south bank near middlesbrough  in 1982 smith asked a passing couple to pose the man balances shopping bags and boxes on a pram while the woman holds a garish painting of elvis presley the title is what she wanted and who she got this is english gritty realism writ large by turns caustically funny and oddly melancholy there is also a recently acquired series of the late linda mccartneys work the most intimate being her portraits of her family when they lived in relative seclusion on the mull of kintryre in the early 70s in one paul in a dressing gown balances on a fence while his son james jumps off a land rover and one of his daughters crouches in the grass it is a study of domestic ordinariness  albeit on a 600acre estate  at a time when the exbeatle was in retreat from his own myth     kings  graham smithtitled this 1982 image what she wanted and who she got photograph  graham smithvampa

sunflower seeds is the titular new work life cycle an enormous refugee boat woven from strands of bamboo and his searing 2017 documentary human flow was an intimate portrait of human displacement the film brought ai to settlement camps in 23 different countries but one of his last stops was los angeles for the promotion of the film despite the artists near constant and global exhibition schedule la had eluded him up until hollywoods intervention joshua roth the uta agent who secured the financing for human flow also invited ai to exhibit in his gallery and introduced him to friends with a newly opened art foundation guess jeans founders paul and maurice marciano     installation view of ai weiwei life cycle photograph courtesy the artist and marciano art foundation    ais los angeles debut arrived at an emotionally fraught moment roth died unexpectedly from heart complications just weeks before his opening coating maf with an air of grief as a tearful maurice marciano introduced the exhibition at that point ai was still mourning the loss of his beijing studio of of 12 years in early august his studio assistants began sending him footage of chinese authorities razing the building to the ground this time alongside other artists studios and migrant workers homes in the name of real estate development in china basically theres no real private property he says everything belongs to the government if they dont let you use it youre violating some kind of law as ais threeyear berlin visa nears its expiration date hes announced plans to move to upstate new york in beijing one studio the compound of his former residence remains but he holds out little hope for it nothing is secure he says if they do destroy it this will be the last one    in china basically theres no real private property  everything belongs to the government  ai weiwei     despite living in europe china has been the headquarters of production for much of ais work he employs scores of master craftsmen specializing in porcelain bamboo silk not only as a material homage to chinese history and tradition but to ensure the necessary precision of their handiwork i cannot accept anything which is not precise or i feel ashamed ai says explaining why on the morning of his jeffrey deitch opening his studio assistants were diligently nudging almost 6000 antique chinese stools by as little as a quarter inch over the gallery floor the original installation was overcrowded he had found and needed to be fixed just hours before show time they were being rearranged and set in place with their legs overlapping at the uniform angle of a line of rockettes the deitch exhibition marked the first time ai had seen the 2014 installation stools in real life he had originally deployed them to berlins gropius bau while he was still detained in china and out of necessity during his fouryear detention he and his studio developed a system of mapping exhibitions remotely using computer renderings his control over the layout of his shows continues to this day we just need to execute the plan deitch says referring to exhibitors of ais work of course it has to be done exactly right a necessity of ais practice which applies to most artists who wish to make a living off of their work is the gift shop component the flip side to making political statements is making highly soughtafter commercial work his projects of populist appeal include skateboards and wine bottle labels bearing images of iconic works at deitch the gallerist chose ai for his inaugural show because for the artists excellent command of space he said but in the gallery stools is overcrowded on all sides with more collectorfriendly works  lego portraits of chinese zodiac animals and a series of precious cubes sculpted from porcelain marble and pricey tea leaves     ai weiwei  caohumanity photograph courtesy uta artist space and photo by jeff mclane    at uta the centerpiece of caohumanity is the lawn of marble blades of grass on the gallery floor with cao meaning grass  an apt metaphor for a mass collection of individual parts  as well as a common substitute for fuck on the censored chinese internet in contrast to the uplifting sentiments of life cycle the forceful expletive is what resounds here an arm holding up its middle finger disembodied not at the shoulder but up to the ear nods to study of perspective a series of photographs taken from 1995 onwards of ais middle finger in front of various world monuments here its been retooled as an arm sculpted in glass and as a graphic that repeats over the wallpaper in the gallery over the course of the three la exhibitions a formula starts to emerge each features a field of objects as its centerpiece sounded by sculptural tokens of grander bodies of work ai spoke to the guardian just before the appointment of brett kavanaugh to the supreme court and criticized the apathy on display during his confirmation hearings characterizing american democracy as a moving concept the top officials theyre not on the side of someone being victimized he said in reference to christine blasey fords allegations of sexual assault this lady has to reveal the most painful moment and you see so many congressmen question her integrity and the whole world is watching privilege and the illusion of freedom have bred a toxic apathy in the united states he says youre living at somebody elses cost and its immoral by not bearing your responsibility what kind of change his or any political artists work can actually achieve remains an open question in his book 95 theses on art and class the art critic ben davis argues that political art is not a force on par with reallife organizing and the indepth analysis of policy the shortcoming of aesthetic political gestures is that while they present us with a problem they rarely offer a course of resolution quoting susan sontag he writes photographs of an atrocity may give rise to opposing responses or simply the bemused awareness continually restocked by photographic information that terrible things happen at this point in time our awareness of widespread displacement famine and a host of global ills has not been enough to reverse them its so easy ai says providing little in the way of strategy just be aware that life is special if were conscious about it then things will change in lieu of answers what his work does provide is a generous relief a moment of levity in a time when humanity badly needs it the momentous power in his art is its ability to draw the public together in collective awe at lacma he closed by telling his audience we are more dependent on each other than any other time  this article was amended on 10 october as originally it was stated that ai weiwei received his passport back in 2014 rather than 2015 ,1512,artanddesign

10,artanddesign/2018/oct/09/anni-albers-tate-modern-review,Anni Albers review ? ravishing textiles that beg to be touched,it is rare to come from an exhibition so buoyed up so ravished and so covetous as i did after seeing anni albers at tate modern her art gives pleasure to the eye and to the mind and to the touch if only one were allowed to touch one wants to feel the braid and nub to finger the frays and proud threads the tightness and looseness and differences between soft and wiry metallic and plastics in her weavings smell too might play its part but mostly all this is in the imagination sensuality  bordering on the sexual  and geometric rigour variety and similarity pleasures that demand being repeated infuse the work of a lifetime in albers show     albers textile art gives pleasure to a room  study for an unexecuted wallhanging 1926 photograph josef and anni albers foundationars new yorkdacs london    i almost inhaled this exhibition that takes us from the bauhaus to black mountain college and to yale  along with her husband the painter josef albers  and from a very particular european modernism to postwar america berlinborn in 1899 anni albers began her studies at the bauhaus in 1922 for all its aspirations to equality like other female students albers was discouraged from joining painting classes and was directed towards the weaving workshop however disciplines are porous and interconnected and few more so than textiles and as julia bryanwilson points out in her marvellous recent book fray art and textile politics just as textiles have stretched between art craft and industry they have also oscillated between being defined as leisure and as labour there are textiles everywhere in our lives our history our cultures our politics at the bauhaus albers found her medium who is to say that she would not have been similarly competent and creative had she entered the painting school or any other here as well as meeting josef albers she came into contact with paul klee whose influence remained strong throughout her career and particularly influenced what she called her pictorial weavings everything is a picture even if it is only a conjunction of stripes lozenges or rectangles even at its most pictorial her art is abstract even at its most geometric it feels human and alive less the product of the mechanics of the loom  the construction of a matrix of threads and fibres warp and weft  than of the hand and the mind anni albers textile art gives pleasure to a room to a wall a bed a floor to the spaces in between things are framed on walls hang freely in space are lain flat the tate exhibition goes from room to room and in spaces created using walls of stretched translucent scrim to outline not just her development but also her processes there are grilles and grids of woven colour closetoned patterns and wandering webs flexing chevrons and teaming bands oddly reminiscent of the untuned pixelated glitches that bedevil the images when were streaming a movie but here the jumbling visual noise resolves in clusters of pattern tiny rows of pictograms and mysterious signs     inextricable entanglements  ancient writing 1936 photograph smithsonian american art museumjosef and anni albers foundationars new yorkdacs london    she drew knots and tangles like madcap versions of those animated diagrams that help fishermen and sailors learn the mechanics of arcane knots except here the pleasure is in following the twists and loops and over and underpasses for nothing more than the pleasure of losing oneself in their inextricable entanglements this is all as good as any abstract art albers made textiles not as a substitute for painting but on its own terms even so whole careers could be made and probably have been from the dozens of different forays she made in her weavings and later in her prints she made drawings from pinpricks through paper and prints from nothing more than the embossment of abstract shapes on heavy white paper as you move around these prints light catches the ridges and depressions first this way then that gleaming against whiteness albers handwoven art is a lesson in colour and geometry method and singularity tactile and optical spatial and utilitarian most of all her work gives pleasure and this exhibition organised in conjunction with k20 in dusseldorf is a revelation and a delight going from room to room i thought of poet wallace stevens three statements presaging the parts of his notes towards a supreme fiction it must be abstract it must change it must give pleasure he wrote albers art did all these things as this retrospective demonstrates although light levels are often low to protect the works with their sometimes fugitive dyes and fragile materials her art sings and vibrates and keeps you looking following patterns and meandering lines mazelike structures grids and colourways the only demand is that you look getting up close and stepping away going from the overall to the detail sensing materiality as well as the optical what a joy  at tate modern london from 11 october to 27 january ,799,artanddesign
